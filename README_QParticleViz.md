# Quantum Particle Interaction Visualization

An educational **particle interaction simulation** inspired by quantum mechanics.  
Particles with positive/negative charges interact via Coulomb-like forces.

### Features
- Real-time particle interaction with attraction/repulsion.
- Force lines drawn between particles to show interactions.
- Adjustable particle parameters (charge, position, velocity).
- Visual teaching tool for subatomic interactions.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Physics simulation in JavaScript using p5.js.
- Visualization of dynamic systems with force interactions.
- Educational UI and interactive elements.

### Run Instructions
Open `quantum_sim.html` in a browser.  
Particles will begin interacting automatically.
